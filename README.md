Koolen-de Vries Syndrome Genotype-Phenotype Repository



This repository contains the curated Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) genotype-phenotype repository generated in our study.  

It integrates detailed clinical and molecular characteristics from 274 molecularly confirmed patients worldwide, together with systematic phenotype-phenotype correlations, variant stratifications, and VUS screening results.



Contents



\- Clinical and molecular characteristics of KdVS patients  

&nbsp; Includes demographic, clinical, and molecular data.  

&nbsp; Notes:  

&nbsp; 1. Country entries reflect patient locations as reported in the original studies; unreported cases default to the corresponding author’s country.  

&nbsp; 2. Phenotypes not recorded are indicated with “/”.  



\- Typical phenotypic characteristics of KdVS  

&nbsp; Summary of core phenotypic features of KdVS for clinical reference.  



\- Phenotype–phenotype correlations  

&nbsp; Pairwise correlations among phenotypic features.  

&nbsp; Significance levels: ns (not significant), P > 0.05; \* P ≤ 0.05; \*\* P ≤ 0.01; \*\*\* P ≤ 0.001.  



\- Phenotypic comparison by variant type and sex  

&nbsp; Comparative analysis of clinical features stratified by variant category and sex.  

&nbsp; Significance levels: ns (not significant), P > 0.05.  



\- KANSL1 VUS identified in the GSRD-100KWCH cohort  

&nbsp; List of 64 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) identified in the GSRD-100KWCH cohort, annotated with detailed clinical phenotypes.  

&nbsp; Variant classification follows ACMG/AMP guidelines (Richards et al., 2015).
