Koolen-de Vries Syndrome Genotype-Phenotype Repository



This repository contains the curated Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) genotype-phenotype repository generated in our study.  

It integrates detailed clinical and molecular characteristics from 274 molecularly confirmed patients worldwide, together with systematic phenotype-phenotype correlations, variant stratifications, and VUS screening results.
